# Coffee Chat

List of awesome people offering their time **for free** to have a "coffee chat" with others about different topics, mostly in a mentorship kind of way.

**Important**: this is not a list to promote your paid services. It is like free as in beer...

PLACEHOLDER

## Add yourself to this list

To add your name to this list, you need to add another object to the `people` array in [people.json](people.json) and send a pull request. See [schema.json](schema.json) for the information about the JSON schema.

If you have no idea how all this works, you can simply send me your information by [email](mailto:hi@fred.dev), and I'll add you to the list myself with pleasure.

**Warning**: only add yourself to this list!

## Remove yourself from this list

Simply create a pull request by removing your people definition from [people.json](people.json). As for adding yourself to the list if you are not a technical person, just send me an [email](mailto:hi@fred.dev) and I'll do it for you.

## Future plans

I put this up quickly, and don't have more time this week to finalize what I had in mind, so here's some things left to do.

- Generate a second list by location (when we'll have more people)
- Generate a third list by discussion topics (when we'll have more people)
- Add GitHub Action for JSON formating
- Add GitHub Action for links validation
- Create pull request template
- Create a CONTRIBUTION.md
- Better formatting of the list including languages, website, city & country (suggestions welcome here)

## Acknoledgements

The idea of a coffee chat resource list is coming from [Julien Lengrand-Lambert.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienlengrand/).
