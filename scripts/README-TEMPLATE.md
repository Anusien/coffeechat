# Coffee Chat

List of awesome people offering their time **for free** to have a "coffee chat" with others about different topics, mostly in a mentorship kind of way.

**Important**: this is not a list to promote your paid services. It is like free as in beer...

PLACEHOLDER

## Add yourself to this list

**Do not modify `README.md` directly: it will be autogenerated**. To add your name to this list, you need to add another object to the `people` array in [people.json](https://github.com/fharper/coffeechat/blob/main/people.json) and send a pull request. See [schema.json](schema.json) for the information about the JSON schema. If the schema property isn't an array like `languages` or `topics`, please add only one item (ex.: you have multiple jobs, please choose only one to add).

Note that your commit need to be signed to ensure the authenticity of the person adding information here: more information on how to do that in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

**Warning**: only add yourself to this list!

## Remove yourself from this list

Simply create a pull request by removing your people definition from [people.json](https://github.com/fharper/coffeechat/blob/main/people.json).

## Acknowledgements
